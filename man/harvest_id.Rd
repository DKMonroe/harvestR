\title{Retrieve Harvest Account ID}
\usage{
harvest_id()
}
\value{
A string of the Harvest Account ID
}
\description{
A convenience function to allow you to store your Harvest
  account ID in a system env variable
}
\details{
The HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID env variable should contain your Harvest
  account ID. Register at \href{https://id.getharvest.com/developers}{Harvest
  Developers}.

  NOTE: The user is advised to do this as her/his own risk and this method
  may not be wise for production systems. System env variables are *not* a
  secure storage mechanism. They are in plain text and a hacker could
  theoretically gain access to your API key once they have access to your
  machine. The recommended approach is to store your API key in a secure
  location, like your keychain, and pull it from there to pass to the
  harvestR package.
